# Ethereal
Is a completely open source geometric modeling kernel built to take advantage of modern computing hardware and solve modern design problems.

Geometry kernels are the machines that make CAD applications work. Geometry kernels are traditionally completely single threaded, making them unable to take advantage of the multithreaded computing power of modern hardware. 

Ethereal will be built from the ground up to take advantage of the multicored computing power of modern cpu's, gpu's and other hardware accelerators. With the goal of creating CAD software that radially changes and improves the design and engineering process.
